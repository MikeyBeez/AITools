The process has been named in honour of Lord Rayleigh, who in 1871 published a paper describing this phenomenon.. The angle through which sunlight in the atmosphere is scattered by molecules of the constituent gases varies inversely as the ... Rayleigh scattering is the interaction of light with particles smaller than its wavelength, such as air molecules in the atmosphere. Learn the formula, the effect of particle size and wavelength, and why the sky is blue. Coherent scattering (also known as Rayleigh, unmodified, classical or elastic scattering) is one of three forms of photon interaction which occurs when the energy of the x-ray or gamma photon is small in relation to the ionization energy of the atom (for instance, during mammography) 5.Such low-energy radiation triggers all the electrons in an atom to vibrate at a similar frequency to the ... Compton and Rayleigh scattering. The Compton scattering, instead of photoelectric effect, involves the free electrons. In matter of course, the electrons are bound to an atom; however, if the photon energy is high with respect to the binding energy, this latter energy can be ignored and the electrons can be treated as essentially free. The meaning of RAYLEIGH SCATTERING is scattering of light by particles small enough to render the effect selective so that different colors are deflected through different angles."
