  "response": "A question that gets to the heart of many a curious mind!\n\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist who first described it in the 19th century. Here's why:\n\nWhen sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the light in all directions.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting: different wavelengths of light (i.e., colors) have varying levels of scattering. Blue light has a shorter wavelength (about 450-495 nanometers) compared to red light (about 620-750 nanometers). As a result, blue light is scattered more efficiently by the atmospheric molecules.\n\nWhen you look up at the sky, you see the scattered blue light because it's been distributed in all directions and reaches your eyes from every part of the sky. The other colors, like red and yellow, are still present but are less scattered and therefore appear as a more intense and diffuse glow around the sun.\n\nSo, to sum it up: the sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric molecules, which favors shorter wavelengths like blue light!\n\nWould you like to explore more questions or topics?
