  "response": "I think there was a bit of a miscommunication! You initially seemed a bit distant, and I wanted to check in and see if everything's okay. But it seems like you're actually just asking a question about France!\n\nThe capital of France is Paris. Would you like to know more about the city or the country? Maybe we can explore something fun together instead?"
