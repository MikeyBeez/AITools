  "response": "Let me elaborate on why the sky appears blue to us!\n\nThe color of the sky is not actually blue, but rather a combination of scattered light and our brain's interpretation. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the light in all directions.\n\nHowever, different wavelengths of light are scattered to varying degrees. The shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n\nAs a result of this scattering, our atmosphere appears blue to us because we see the scattered blue light from all directions. The color of the sky can also appear different at sunrise and sunset due to the angle of the sun's rays and the amount of dust and water vapor in the air.\n\nWould you like me to clarify anything else?"
